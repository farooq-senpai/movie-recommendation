# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

A **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. This project leverages machine learning and collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations.

## ðŸ”¹ Features

* **Personalized Recommendations:** Suggests movies based on user ratings and preferences.
* **Search Functionality:** Search movies by title, genre, or year.
* **Movie Details:** Displays relevant information like ratings, release date, and synopsis.
* **Interactive UI:** User-friendly interface for easy navigation (if applicable).

## ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries & Frameworks:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Flask/Django (if using web app), Surprise (for collaborative filtering)
* **Database:** CSV, SQLite, or any database used for storing movie data
* **Frontend (Optional):** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## ðŸ”¹ How It Works

1. Collect movie ratings and metadata.
2. Preprocess data (cleaning, normalization, feature extraction).
3. Train a recommendation model (Collaborative Filtering / Content-Based Filtering / Hybrid Model).
4. Generate personalized recommendations for each user.
5. Display recommended movies through a simple interface or API.

## ðŸ”¹ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd movie-recommendation
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## ðŸ”¹ Usage

* Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` (for Flask) or the respective URL.
* Search for your favorite movies.
* Get personalized recommendations instantly.

## ðŸ”¹ Dataset

* The project uses the **[MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)** (or specify your dataset).
* Contains movie metadata, user ratings, and tags.

## ðŸ”¹ Future Improvements

* Implement **real-time recommendations** using streaming data.
* Enhance the UI with advanced front-end frameworks (React, Vue.js).
* Add **genre-based filters** and **watchlists**.
* Integrate with external APIs (IMDB, TMDB) for richer movie data.
